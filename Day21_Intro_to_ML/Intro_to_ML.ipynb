    "### <u>Traditional vs. Machine Learning</u>:\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a method of teaching computers to learn patterns and make decisions from data instead of giving them fixed step-by-step instructions. In traditional programming, a programmer writes specific rules, and the computer follows those rules to produce results. The logic is clearly defined by humans, and the output depends completely on the instructions given. However, in Machine Learning, the approach is different. Instead of writing all the rules manually, we provide the computer with large amounts of data along with the correct answers, and the system learns the patterns on its own. It studies the examples, identifies relationships within the data, and builds its own internal logic to make predictions or decisions. This process allows computers to handle complex problems where writing exact rules is difficult or impossible. Because of this shift from rule-based programming to data-driven learning, Machine Learning has become very powerful and useful in real-world applications such as spam detection, recommendation systems, medical diagnosis, and many more. \n",

    "<u>Supervised Learning</u>: uses labeled data, such as spam detection or predicting house prices, where correct answers are already known. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Unsupervised Learning</u>: works with unlabeled data and finds hidden patterns, such as grouping customers based on shopping behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Reinforcement Learning</u>: learns through rewards and penalties, like training a game AI or teaching a robot how to move. This difference between rule-based programming and learning from data is what makes Machine Learning powerful and flexible.\n"
